**A copy of the school project - SQL Database History Manager**

The aim of this program was to allow the user to view the history of actions performed on the selected database. I was responsible for the making of the GUI/font-end, while other members of the Asi-FX team were responsible for the making of the application backend.

The whole project was written in Java, using libraries such as JavaFX, SQL etc.
